# WLTE(C) Project

**WLTE(C)** stands for **Windows Lightweight Text Editor (Customizable)**.  
This project was created to expand my knowledge in the **software engineering** field.

## Features
- Customizable interface (fonts, colors, etc.)
- Clipboard support (copy & paste)
- I/O operations (write to file, read from file)
- Full unicode support

## Installation
just know that settings and font folders have to be in the same directory as executable and dlls
for it to find the cfg files and work flawlessly.
